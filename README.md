**Introduction**

- The software to be designed will control a simulated automated teller machine (ATM) having a magnetic stripe reader for reading an ATM card, a keyboard and display for interaction with the customer, a slot for depositing envelopes, a dispenser for cash, a printer for printing customer receipts, and a key-operated switch to allow an operator to start or stop the machine.
- The ATM will communicate with the bank&#39;s computer over an appropriate communication link.

**Research**

- The first ATM in India was presented by HSBC bank in 1987 at Mumbai branch for withdrawal.
- The ATM was introduced with an objective to serve the customers during emergency situations where cash deposits and withdrawals after regular banking hours are required.

- Many significant changes like account transfer from one-person account to another account holders, requisition claims like chequebook need, message alert etc. were noted after 2000.
